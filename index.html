                <p class="list-group-item-text">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                    <h4>Unvaccinated Ontario teachers must submit to twice weekly COVID-19 testing: ministry memo</h4>

                        Ontario public school teachers who choose not to receive or are medically exempt from COVID-19 vaccination will have to submit to rapid testing at least twice per week, and will have to go to a nearby pharmacy to do so for the first two weeks of school.

                        “Individuals subject to testing requirements must provide verification of negative test results at least two times per week as an added measure to protect schools from the risk of COVID-19,” Deputy Education Minister Nancy Naylor wrote in a memo obtained by CTV News Toronto.
                        
                        Details of the testing regime for teachers were first reported in the Toronto Star.
                        
                        
                        And for the first two weeks of school until about Sept. 20, most schools and board offices will not yet have access to the rapid antigen testing kits, so unvaccinated teachers are being directed to local pharmacies to complete the testing.
                        
                        “The government is authorizing pharmacies to provide publicly funded COVID-19 rapid antigen testing services effective Tuesday, September 7, 2021 until Tuesday September 21,” the memo states.
                        
                        “This will involve temporary free access to rapid antigen testing in the pharmacy setting for those individuals subject to the employer’s policy (i.e. those that are attesting to not being fully vaccinated). Individuals subject to the employer policy will need to show valid ID and a letter from employer."
                        
                        Naylor’s memo said the province is also working on a smartphone app so teachers can quickly upload test results to school boards.
                        
                        The province announced a vaccine disclosure policy on Aug. 17, where healthcare and education workers would at a minimum, submit to regular rapid testing for COVID-19 if they choose not to get a vaccine.
                        
                        Some school boards, including the Toronto District School Board, are in the process of developing an even more stringent COVID-19 vaccination policy for staff.
                        
                        The province also altered its COVID-19 outbreak management guidance to give vaccinated teachers and students the ability to remain at school in the event of an exposure if they do not develop any symptoms.
                        
                        By Sept. 22, COVID-19 vaccination will be required to participate in indoor activities such as concerts, dining, fitness centre exercise and indoor sporting events.

                <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"><b>1. Accuracy</b>
                    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Economics</b>
                    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                    <br>
                   <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
